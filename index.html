        <h3>Step 1</h3>

        Beat butter and shortening with an electric mixer on medium 
        to high speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar, baking powder, 
        and salt; beat until combined. Beat in egg, 1 tablespoon milk, 
        and vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. 
        Stir in remaining flour with a wooden spoon. 
        Divide dough in half. 
        If necessary, cover and chill dough for 3 hours or until easy to handle.

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        
        Roll each portion dough on a lightly floured surface until 1/4 inch thick. 
        cut with a fish-shape cutter. Place cutouts 1 inch apart on cookie sheets lined with foil.

        Use aspic cutters or a sharp knife to cut decorative designs in the dough. 
        Fill cutouts with crushed hard candies.

        <h3>Step 4</h3> 
        Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 8 to 9 minutes or until edges are set. 
        Cool cookies completely on foil on wire racks. When cool, peel foil off cookies.
